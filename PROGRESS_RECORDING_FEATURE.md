- **Quick actions** for marking today's tasks complete
- **Calendar view** for recurring tasks showing due dates and completion status
- **Custom date selection** for one-time tasks
- **Smart validation** preventing duplicate entries and invalid dates

#### ProgressCalendar

- **Single completion** tracking

#### Recurring Tasks
- **Calendar interface** showing all due dates
- **Multiple completion tracking** across different dates
- **Visual progress indicators** for each due date
- **Automatic calculation** of overall progress percentage

### 5. User Experience Features

#### Smart Interactions
- **Due today alerts** with special highlighting
- **Prevent duplicate entries** for the same date
- **Loading states** during API calls
- **Success/error notifications** with clear messaging

#### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-friendly** calendar and dialog layouts
- **Touch-friendly** buttons and interactions
- **Consistent styling** with MudBlazor theme

#### Accessibility
- **Keyboard navigation** support
- **Screen reader friendly** with proper ARIA labels
- **High contrast** visual indicators

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Clean separation** between UI and business logic
- **Proper error handling** at all layers
- **Consistent data flow** from domain to UI
- **Performance optimized** with minimal API calls

### Data Flow
1. User clicks "Record Progress" button
2. UI fetches detailed progress information via `GetTaskProgressDetailAsync()`
3. Dialog displays current progress and available actions
4. User selects date(s) to record progress
5. UI calls `RecordTaskProgressAsync()` to save progress
6. Dialog refreshes to show updated progress
7. Parent components refresh to reflect changes

### Validation
- **Date validation**: Cannot record progress for future dates
- **Duplicate prevention**: Cannot record progress twice for the same date
- **Task state validation**: Only allows progress on active tasks
- **Due date constraints**: Only allows progress on valid due dates

## Usage Examples

### Recording Progress for One-Time Task
1. Navigate to task list or task detail page
2. Click "Record Progress" button
3. Select completion date (defaults to today)
4. Click "Record Progress" to save

### Recording Progress for Recurring Task
1. Navigate to task list or task detail page
2. Click "Record Progress" button
3. Use calendar to click on due dates to mark complete
4. View progress summary and completion percentage

### Quick Actions
- For tasks due today, use "Mark Completed Today" button for instant recording
- Calendar view allows bulk recording for multiple dates

## Localization

All UI text is properly localized with support for:
- English (complete)
- Extensible for additional languages

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- **Bulk progress recording** for multiple tasks
- **Progress notes** with comments for each entry
- **Progress analytics** with charts and trends
- **Reminder notifications** for overdue tasks
- **Progress export** functionality
- **Team progress tracking** for shared tasks

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create test tasks** of both one-time and recurring types
2. **Test progress recording** for various scenarios
3. **Verify calendar functionality** for recurring tasks
4. **Test error handling** with invalid inputs
5. **Check responsive design** on different screen sizes
6. **Validate accessibility** with screen readers
